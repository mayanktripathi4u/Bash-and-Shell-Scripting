# Welcome to the Bash and Shell Scripting Page.
This is just an introduction page, and the repository will  have all the bash scripts from scratch to advance.
Though its a basic level or foundation information which most of your already know, still it has essential stuff that will help you to appreciate why and how certian things behave the way they do once we start playing about with the fun stuff.

In layman's terms, just consider of a movie script for a movie, play script for a play, or a TV scripts for a TV show. 
The script tells the actors / actoress "what they should say", "when to say" and "what to do". 
In the same way a script for a computer tells the computer "what it should do" or "say" meaning response. 
In the context of Bash scripts we are telling the Bash shell "what it should do" and "when to do".

# What is Bash Scripting?
Bash is a command programming languages.

Bash or Bourne-again shell is one of the most popular shells and command languages for Linux VPS enthusiasts. 
It was first released in 1989 and was used as the default shell for most Linux distributions ever since.

Bash scripting allows users and system administrators to automate processes and save hundreds of hours of manual work. Itâ€™s worth mentioning that Bash is also available for Windows and macOS.

A Bash script is a plain text file which contains a series of commands. These commands are a mixture of commands we would normally type ouselves on the command line.

Anything which you can run normally on the command line / terminal can be put into a script and it will do exactly the same thing. Similarly, anything you put into a script can also be run normally on the command line / terminal and it will do the exactly same thing.
You don't need to change anything. Just type the commands as you would normally type on terminal and they will behave as they would normally. It's just that instead of typing them at the command line we are now entering them into a plain text file. 
In this sense, if you know how to do stuff at the command line then you already know a fair bit in terms of Bash scripting.

Just make a note that the plain text file for the bash script has an extension of .sh (for example "mybashscript.sh").


# What is Shell Scripting?
As per wikipedia -- A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by a Unix shell, a command-line interpreter. The various dialects of shell scripts are considered to be scripting languages. 
Typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text.

# Difference between Bash Scripting Vs Shell Scripting?
Shell scripting is scripting in any shell, whereas Bash scripting is scripting specifically for Bash.
bash and shell are two different shells of the Unix operating system. bash is sh, but with more features and better syntax.

# Python Vs Bash.
Python is more flexible than Bash because you can run its scripts on different platforms, such as macOS, Windows, Linux, etc. 
Python is designed to create a simple-to-read program, while Bash is the command-line interpreter to execute commands automatically.

# What Bash Scripting has?
As mentioned earlier that Bash is a command programming languages, similar to other programming languages, Bash also has 
	* Variables
	* Math Functions
	* if statements
	* exit codes 
	* while loops
	* universal update script
	* for loops
	* FileSystem locations for scripts
	* Data Streams
	* Functions
	* Case statements
	* Scheduling jobs 
	* Arguments
	* Creating a backup script

# How to  Start?
Writing a Bash Script is fairly easy and straight forward.

## Option 1 : Linux Terminal
First open the Linux Terminal if you the linux distribution.

## Option 2 : Windows machine
Download the GitBash and install it as a easy way to work on bash script in Windows.
Connect to GitBash, type the command as "where bash", this will return the path where the bash is.

## Understand the code.
Let's break it down:

Line 1 - Is what's referred to as the shebang. See below for what this is.
Line 2 - This is a comment. Anything after # is not executed. It is for our reference only.
Line 4 - Is the command echo which will print a message to the screen. You can type this command yourself on the command line and it will behave exactly the same.
The syntax highlighting is there only to make it easier to read and is not something you need to do in your own files (remember they are just plain text files).

# How to run?
Running a Bash script is fairly easy.
